  sentences:
  - 'In particular , we focus on the case of reconstructing polarized signal emitted
    in the radio and sub-mm regimes : i ) at [MATH_tex=nulesssimSI60GHz] where the
    emission is mostly dominated by Galactic synchrotron , described by a power law
    [MATH_tex=beta_synchsim-3] \citep 2018A Align A…618A.166K , ii ) at [MATH_tex=nugtrsimSI150GHz]
    where most of the polarization is due to the thermal Galactic dust grains aligning
    with the Galactic magnetic field , described by a modified blackbody law \citep
    planck2018 . In this study , we mainly focus on inpainting maps of polarized emissions
    in two microwave regimes : namely synchrotron and thermal dust .'
  - More specifically , we assume an NFW density profile , a general Schechter luminosity
    function and a Gaussian model for BCGs to model clusters , and use the spectroscopic
    measurements and obtained error distributions of galaxy photometric redshifts
    from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to incorporate redshift uncertainties .

    the high Galactic latitude blank sky observations measured with the small FOVs
    in three COR regions are shown in Figure 8 .

    constraint on the Hubble constant in these two model-independent reconstructions
    , and the results are consistent with both Planck 2018 and SH0ES 2019 .

    monitored . The basic properties of the sample are listed in Table 1 in the first
    columns : Identification , R.A. , Declination , pulsation period , galactic coordinates
    . The observations were carried out with the SOFI infra-red camera on the 3.5m

    are ( re ) accelerated by outward moving shocks to a Lorentz factor of [MATH_tex=gamma_esim

  - Briefly , we use the SExtractor shape parameters ( [MATH_tex=C_xx] , [MATH_tex=C_xy]
    , and [MATH_tex=C_yy] ) to define an ellipse for each object in the field , and
    we identify the host as the object that includes the supernova position inside
    its ellipse with the smallest possible scaling unless the scaling factor , [MATH_tex=R]
    , is greater than 5 .
  - A summary of the main modifications of the imager setup is presented in table
    5 . SNLS exploits the DEEP component of the CFHT Legacy Survey ( CFHTLS ) , which
