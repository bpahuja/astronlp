        "abstract": "A recent stellar occultation by dwarf planet Makemake provided an excellent opportunity to measure the size and shape of one of the largest objects in the Kuiper belt . The analysis of these results provided what were reported to be precise measurements of the lengths of the projected axes , the albedo , and even the density of Makemake , but these results were , in part , derived from qualitative arguments . We reanalyzed the occultation timing data using a quantitative statistical description , and , in general , find the previously reported results on the shape of Makemake to be unjustified . In our solution , in which we use our inference from photometric data that Makemake is being viewed nearly pole-on , we find a 1\\sigmaupper limit to the projected elongation of Makemake of 1.02 , with measured equatorial diameter of 1434\\pm14 km and a projected polar diameter of 1422\\pm14 km , yielding an albedo of 0.81^ { +0.01 } _ { -0.02 }. If we remove the external constraint on the pole position of Makemake , we find instead a 1\\sigmaupper limit to the elongation of 1.06 , with a measured equatorial diameter of 1434^ { +48 } _ { -18 }km and a projected polar diameter of 1420^ { +18 } _ { -24 }km , yielding an albedo of 0.81^ { +0.03 } _ { -0.05 }. Critically , we find that the reported measurement of the density of Makemake was based on the misapplication of the volatile retention models . A corrected analysis shows that the occultation measurements provide no meaningful constraint on the density of Makemake .",

Using our global , self-consistent , multi-band model of nearby well-observed supernovae , we find that the covariances of these quantities are strong and that the confidence ellipsoids are oriented in the direction of the correlations , which reduces their significance . By proper treatment of the covariance matrix of the model , we discover a significant intrinsic width to the correlations betweenL _ { pl },E _ { exp }andM _ { Ni }, where the uncertainties due to the distance and the extinction dominate . For fixedE _ { exp }, the spread inM _ { Ni }is about0.25dex , which we attribute to the differences in the progenitor internal structure . We argue that the effects of incomplete\\gamma-ray trapping are not important in our sample . Similarly , the physics of the Type II-Plateau supernova light curves leads to inherently degenerate estimates ofE _ { exp }andM _ { ej }, which makes their observed correlation weak . Ignoring the covariances of supernova parameters or the intrinsic width of the correlations causes significant biases in the slopes of the fitted relations . Our results imply that Type II-Plateau supernova explosions are not described by a single physical parameter or a simple one-dimensional trajectory through the parameter space , but instead reflect the diversity of the core and surface properties of their progenitors . We discuss the implications for the physics of the explosion mechanism and possible future observational constraints .",

Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as parameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival ( TOAs ) . TOAs measured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield position measurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision . However , timing-based astrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise , which can be compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitational wave background . We investigate how noise of different spectral types is absorbed by timing models , leading to significant estimation biases in the astrometric parameters . We find that commonly used techniques for fitting timing models in the presence of red noise ( Cholesky whitening ) prevent the absorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline of observations exceeds several years , but are inadequate for dealing with shorter pulsar data sets . Independent of timing , pulsar-optimized very long baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) is capable of providing position estimates precise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing . In order to make VLBI astrometric parameters useful in pulsar timing models , the transformation between the International Celestial Reference Frame ( ICRF ) and the dynamical solar system ephemeris used for pulsar timing must be constrained to within a few microarcseconds . We compute a transformation between the ICRF and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how the transformation will improve in coming years . We find that incorporating VLBI astrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of years of timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noise and could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fit timing residuals by factors of 20 or more .",

In particular , we want to estimate the active galactic nucleus ( AGN ) contribution to the LIRGs and ULIRGs \u2019 infrared emission and which types of AGNs are related to their activity . Methods : We examined 69 galaxies at redshift\\geq0.05 detected at 90\\mum by the AKARI satellite in the AKARI Deep-Field South ( ADF-S ) , with optical counterparts and spectral coverage from the ultraviolet to the FIR . We used two independent spectral energy distribution fitting codes : one fitting the SED from FIR to FUV ( CIGALE ) ( we use the results from CIGALE as a reference ) and gray-body + power spectrum fit for the infrared part of the spectra (CMCIRSED) in order to identify a subsample of ULIRGs and LIRGs , and to estimate their properties . Results : Based on the CIGALE SED fitting , we have found that LIRGs and ULIRGs selected at the 90\\mum AKARI band compose\\sim56 % of our sample ( we found 17 ULIRGs and 22 LIRGs , spanning over the redshift range 0.06<z<1.23 ) . Their physical parameters , such as stellar mass , star formation rate ( SFR ) , and specific SFR are consistent with the ones found for other samples selected at infrared wavelengths . We have detected a significant AGN contribution to the mid-infrared luminosity for 63 % of LIRGs and ULIRGs . Our LIRGs contain Type 1 , Type 2 , and intermediate types of AGN , whereas for ULIRGs , a majority ( more than 50 % ) of AGN emission originates from Type 2 AGNs . The temperature\u2013luminosity and temperature\u2013mass relations for the dust component of ADF\u2013S LIRGs and ULIRGs indicate that these relations are shaped by the dust mass and not by the increased dust heating . Conclusions : We conclude that LIRGs contain Type 1 , Type 2 , and intermediate types of AGNs , with an AGN contribution to the mid infrared emission at the median level of 13\\pm3 % , whereas the majority of ULIRGs contain Type 2 AGNs , with a median AGN fraction equal to 19\\pm8 % .",

        "abstract": "We present an analysis of X-ray observations of the Galactic supernova remnants ( SNRs ) HB21 ( G89.0+4.7 ) and CTB 1 ( G116.9+0.2 ) , two well-known members of the class of mixed-morphology ( MM ) SNRs . Our analysis draws upon observations of both SNRs made with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA) : we have also used an archivedChandraobservation of CTB 1 as part of this effort . We find a marked contrast between the X-ray properties of HB21 and CTB 1 : in the case of HB21 , the extracted spectra of the northwest and southeast regions of the X-ray emitting plasma associated with the SNR can be fit with a single thermal model with marginally enhanced silicon and sulfur abundances . For both of these regions , the derived column density and temperature areN_ { H }\\sim0.3\\times10^ { 22 }cm^ { -2 }and\\it { kT }\\sim0.7 keV , respectively . No significant spatial differences in temperature or elemental abundances between the two regions are detected and the X-ray-emitting plasma for both regions is close to ionization equilibrium . OurChandraspectral analysis of CTB 1 reveals that this source is likely an oxygen-rich SNR with enhanced abundances of oxygen and neon : this result is quite surprising for an evolved SNR like CTB 1 . The high angular resolutionChandraobservation of CTB 1 reveals spectral variations across this SNR : in particular , we have detected localized hard emission with an angular extent of\\sim 1 ^ { \\prime }. The extractedASCAspectra for both the southwest and northeastern regions of CTB 1 can not be fit with a single thermal component and instead an additional component is required to account for the presence of excess emission seen at higher energies . Based on our fits to the extractedASCAspectra , we derive a column densityN_ { H }\\sim0.6\\times10^ { 22 }cm^ { -2 }and a temperature for the soft thermal component of\\it { kT }_ { soft }\\sim0.28 keV for both regions . The hard emission from the southwest region may be modeled with either a thermal component with a temperature\\it { kT }_ { hard }\\sim3 keV or by a power law component with a photon index\\Gamma\\sim2-3 ; for the northeast region the hard emission may be modeled with a power law component with a photon index\\Gamma= 1.4 . The detection of center-filled ejecta-dominated X-ray emission from HB21 and CTB 1 as well as other MM SNRs suggests a new scenario for the origin of contrasting X-ray and radio morphologies of this class of sources . Lastly , we have analyzed the properties of the discrete hard X-ray source 1WGA J0001.4+6229 which is seen in projection just inside the northeastern shell of CTB 1 . Our extractedASCAGIS spectra of this source are best fit using a power-law model with a photon index\\Gamma=2.2^ { +0.5 } _ { -1.2 }: this slope is typical for featureless power-law continua produced by rotation-powered pulsars . This source may be a neutron star associated with CTB 1 . We find marginal evidence for X-ray pulsations from this source with a period of 47.6154 milliseconds . A deep radio observation of this source failed to reveal any pulsations .",

Moreover , a significant spectral evolution appears to be present , the source exhibiting a much softer spectrum than in the past . Comparison of the present properties of 1RXS J170849.0\u2013400910 with those from archival data shows a clear correlation between the X-ray flux and the spectral hardness . In particular , the flux and the spectral hardness reached a maximum level close to the two glitches the source experienced in 1999 and in 2001 , and successively decreased . Although the excellentXMM\u2013Newtonspectral resolution should in principle allow us to detect the absorption line reported in a phase-resolved spectrum withBeppoSAX , and interpreted as a cyclotron feature , we found no absorption features , neither in the phase averaged spectrum nor in the phase resolved spectra . We discuss in detail both the possibilities that the feature in theBeppoSAX data may have resulted from a spurious detection or that it is real and intrinsically variable . We then discuss a possible explanation for the glitches and for the softening of the source emission which followed the flux decrease , in the framework of the magnetar model .",

These studies have raised important issues regarding the behavior of this population of remnants of the once massive stars in early-type galaxies , namely the connection between LMXBs and globular clusters ( GCs ) and the nature of the LMXB luminosity function ( LF ) . In this paper , we combine five epochs ofChandraobservations and one central fieldHubble Space TelescopeAdvance Camera for Surveys observation of NGC 4697 , one of the nearest , optically luminous elliptical ( E6 ) galaxies , to probe the GC-LMXB connection and LMXB-LF down to a detection/completeness limit of0.6 / 1.4 \\times 10 ^ { 37 } { ergs s } ^ { -1 }.

We confirm that a broken power-law is the best fit to the LMXB-LF , although we can not rule out a cutoff power-law , and argue that this raises the possibility that there is no universal form for the LMXB-LF in early-type galaxies .

        "abstract": "We make a detailed study of matter density perturbations in both metric and Palatini formalisms . Considering general theories whose Lagrangian density is a general function ,f ( R ), of the Ricci scalarR, we derive the equation of matter density perturbations in each case , in a number of gauges , including comoving , longitudinal and uniform density gauges . We show that for viablef ( R )models that satisfy cosmological and local gravity constraints ( LGC ) , matter perturbation equations derived under a sub-horizon approximation are valid even for super-Hubble scales provided the oscillating mode ( scalaron ) does not dominate over the matter-induced mode . Such approximate equations are especially reliable in the Palatini formalism because of the absence of scalarons . Using these equations we make a comparative study of the behaviour of matter density perturbations as well as gravitational potentials for a number of classes off ( R )theories . In the metric formalism the quantitym = Rf _ { ,RR } / f _ { ,R }that characterises the deviation from the\\LambdaCDM model is constrained to be very small during a matter era in order to ensure compatibility with LGC , but the models in whichmgrows to the order of10 ^ { -1 }around the present epoch can be allowed . These models also suffer from an additional fine tuning due to the presence of scalaron oscillating modes which are absent in the Palatini case . In Palatini formalism LGC and background cosmological constraints provide only weak bounds on|m|by constraining it to be smaller than\\sim 0.1. This is in contrast to matter density perturbations which , on galactic scales , place far more stringent constraints on the present deviation parametermof the order of|m| \\lesssim 10 ^ { -5 }\u201310 ^ { -4 }. This is due to the peculiar evolution of matter perturbations in the Palatini case which exhibits a rapid growth or a damped oscillation depending on the sign ofm.",

Such binaries can not harbor hydrogen rich donor stars . As with other ( sometimes confirmed ) ultracompact LMXBs , 2S 0918\u2013549 is observed to have a high neon-to-oxygen abundance ratio ( Juett et al . 2001 ) which has been used to argue that the companion star is a CO or ONe white dwarf . However , type-I X-ray bursts have been observed from several of these systems implying the presence of hydrogen or helium on the neutron star surface . In this paper , we argue that the companion star in 2S 0918\u2013549 is a helium white dwarf We first present a Type I X-ray burst from 2S 0918\u2013549 with a long duration of 40 minutes . We show that this burst is naturally explained by accretion of pure helium at the inferred accretion rate of\\sim 0.01times the Eddington accretion rate . At higher accretion rates of\\sim 0.1Eddington , hydrogen is required to explain long duration bursts . However , at low rates the long duration is due to the large amount of helium that accumulates prior to the burst . We show that it is possible to form a helium white dwarf donor in an ultracompact binary if accretion starts during the first ascent of the giant branch , when the core is made of predominantly helium . Furthermore , this scenario naturally explains the high neon-to-oxgen ratio , without requiring a CO or ONe white dwarf companion . The only observational aspect of 2S 0918\u2013549 that we can not explain is the absence of helium lines in the optical spectrum . Model calculations of optical accretion disk spectra need to be carried out in order to obtain limits on the helium abundance .",

On shorter timescales , a possible 1.4-hr variability was found in the optical light curves which might be related to the mHz quasi-periodic oscillations seen in other LMXBs . We do not find any significant X-ray/optical correlation in the light curves . In X-rays , the colour-colour diagram and hardness-intensity diagram indicate that the source shows characteristics of an atoll source in the upper banana state , with a correlation between intensity and spectral hardness . Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy suggests that two-component spectral models give a reasonable fit to the X-ray emission .

For such a total-energy scheme applied to the formation of a single shock , convergence of a Cauchy error approaches the expected rate slowly . We relate this slowness to the effect of varying diffusion , due to varying linear artificial-viscous length , on small-amplitude waves . In an appendix we discuss the scaling of shock-transition regions with viscous lengths , and exhibit several difficulties for attempts to make extrapolations .",

        "abstract": "The inspiral of a stellar compact object into a massive black hole , an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral , is one of the main sources of gravitational waves for the future space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna . We expect to be able to detect and analyze many cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems , which makes them truly high precision tools for gravitational-wave astronomy . To that end , the use of very precise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required . To build them we need to have a deep understanding of the gravitational backreaction mechanism responsible for the inspiral . The self-force approach describes the inspiral as the action of a local force that can be obtained from the regularization of the perturbations created by the stellar compact object on the massive black hole geometry . In this paper we extend a new time-domain technique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the case of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole . The main idea behind our scheme is to use a multidomain framework in which the small compact object , described as a particle , is located at the interface between two subdomains . Then , the equations at each subdomain are homogeneous wave-type equations , without distributional sources . In thisparticle-without-particleformulation , the solution of the equations is smooth enough to provide good convergence properties for the numerical computations . This formulation is implemented by using a pseudospectral collocation method for the spatial discretization , combined with a Runge Kutta algorithm for the time evolution . We present results from several simulations of eccentric orbits in the case of a scalar charged particle around a Schwarzschild black hole , an excellent testbed model for testing the techniques for self-force computations . In particular , we show the convergence of the method and its ability to resolve the field and its derivatives across the particle location . Finally , we provide numerical values of the self-force for different orbital parameters .",

        "abstract": "We present a semi-analytic model for the interstellar medium that considers local processes and structures of turbulent star-forming gas . A volume element of the interstellar medium is described as a multi-phase system , comprising a cold and a warm gas phase in effective ( thermal plus turbulent ) pressure equilibrium , and a stellar component . The cooling instability of the warm gas feeds the cold phase , while various heating processes transfer cold gas to the warm phase . The cold phase consists of clumps embedded in diffuse warm gas , where only the molecular fraction of the cold gas may be converted into stars . The fraction of molecular gas is approximately calculated , using a Str\u00f6mgren-like approach , and the efficiency of star formation is determined by the state of the cold gas and by the turbulent velocity dispersion on the clump length scale . Gas can be heated by supernovae and UV-emission of massive stars , according to the evolutionary stages of the stellar populations and the initial mass function . Since turbulence has a critical impact on the shape of the gaseous phases , on the production of molecular hydrogen and on the formation of stars , the consistent treatment of turbulent energy \u2013 the kinetic energy of unresolved motions \u2013 is an important new feature of our model . Besides turbulence production by supernovae and by the cooling instability , we also take into account the forcing by large scale motions . We formulate a set of ordinary differential equations , which statistically describes star formation and the exchange between the different budgets of mass and energy in a region of the interstellar medium with given mean density , size , metallicity and external turbulence forcing . By exploring the behaviour of the solutions , we find equilibrium states , in which the star formation efficiencies are consistent with observations . Kennicutt-Schmidt-like relations naturally arise from the equilibrium solutions , while conventional star formation models in numerical simulations impose such relations with observed efficiency parameters as phenomenological calibrations . Beyond the semi-analytic approach , a potential application is a complete subgrid scale model of the unresolved multi-phase structure , star formation and turbulence in simulations of galaxies or in cosmological simulations . The formulation presented in this article combines various models focusing on particular processes and yet can be adopted to specific applications , depending on the range of resolved length scales .",

        "abstract": "Low-mass objects embedded in isothermal protoplanetary discs are known to suffer rapid inward Type I migration . In non-isothermal discs , recent work has shown that a decreasing radial profile of the disc entropy can lead to a strong positive corotation torque which can significantly slow down or reverse Type I migration in laminar viscous disc models , depending on the amount of viscous and thermal diffusion operating in the planet \u2019 s horseshoe region . Since the latter is a fraction of the pressure scale height of the disc , it is not clear however how this picture changes in turbulent disc models . The aim of this study is to examine the impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a low-mass planet embedded in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc . We particularly focus on the role of turbulence on the corotation torque whose amplitude depends on the efficiency of diffusion processes in the planet \u2019 s horseshoe region . The main issues we want to address are whether the part of the corotation torque scaling with the entropy gradient can remain unsaturated in the presence of turbulence and whether the saturation process in non-isothermal discs can be satisfactorily modelled using laminar disc models . We performed 2D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in which turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing . In order to provide estimations for the viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients as a function of the amplitude of turbulence , we first set up non-isothermal disc models for different values of the amplitude of the turbulent forcing . We then include a low-mass planet and determine the evolution of its running time-averaged torque . We show that in non-isothermal discs , the entropy-related corotation torque can indeed remain unsaturated in the presence of turbulence . For turbulence amplitudes that do not strongly affect the disc temperature profile , we find that the running time-averaged torque experienced by an embedded protoplanet is in fairly good agreement with laminar disc models with appropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients and with the formulae of Paardekooper et al . ( 2011 ) for the total torque in non-isothermal discs . In discs with turbulence driven by stochastic forcing , the corotation torque therefore behaves similarly as in laminar viscous discs and can be responsible for significantly slowing down or reversing Type I migration .",

Results from the nearly 11 years of monitoring are presented here . Structure functions are used to measure the UV-optical and X-ray power spectra . The X-ray structure function measured between10 - 100days is consistent with the flat , low-frequency part of the power spectrum measured previously in Mrk 335 . The UV-optical structure functions of Mrk 335 are comparable with those of other Seyfert 1 galaxies and of Mrk 335 itself when it was in a normal bright state . There is no indication that the current X-ray low-flux state is attributed to changes in the accretion disc structure of Mrk 335 . The characteristic timescales measured in the structure functions can be attributed to thermal ( for the UV ) and dynamic ( for the optical ) timescales in a standard accretion disc . The high-quality UVW2 (\\sim 1800 { \\thinspace \\AA }in the source frame ) structure function appears to have two breaks and two different slopes between10 - 160days . Correlations between the X-ray and other bands are not highly significant when considering the entire 11-year light curves , but more significant behaviour is present when considering segments of the light curves . A correlation between the X-ray and UVW2 in 2014 ( Year-8 ) may be predominately caused by an giant X-ray flare that was interpreted as jet-like emission . In 2008 ( Year-2 ) , possible lags between the UVW2 emission and other UV-optical waveband may be consistent with reprocessing of X-ray or UV emission in the accretion disc .",

Aims : We present multiwavelength observations of this source from April 2008 to March 2010 . The radio to optical data are mostly from the GASP-WEBT , UV and X-ray data from Swift , and\\gamma-ray data from the AGILE and Fermi satellites . The aim is to understand the connection among emissions at different frequencies and to derive information on the emitting jet . Methods : Light curves in 18 bands were carefully assembled to study flux variability correlations . We improved the calibration of optical\u2013UV data from the UVOT and OM instruments and estimated the Ly\\alphaflux to disentangle the contributions from different components in this spectral region . Results : The observations reveal prominent variability above 8 GHz . In the optical\u2013UV band , the variability amplitude decreases with increasing frequency due to a steadier radiation from both a broad line region and an accretion disc . The optical flux reaches nearly the same levels in the 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010 observing seasons ; the mm one shows similar behaviour , whereas the\\gammaand X-ray flux levels rise in the second period . Two prominent\\gamma-ray flares in mid 2008 and late 2009 show a double-peaked structure , with a variable\\gamma/optical flux ratio . The X-ray flux variations seem to follow the\\gamma-ray and optical ones by about 0.5 and 1 d , respectively . Conclusions : We interpret the multifrequency behaviour in terms of an inhomogeneous curved jet , where synchrotron radiation of increasing wavelength is produced in progressively outer and wider jet regions , which can change their orientation in time . In particular , we assume that the long-term variability is due to this geometrical effect . By combining the optical and mm light curves to fit the\\gammaand X-ray ones , we find that the\\gamma( X-ray ) emission may be explained by inverse-Comptonisation of synchrotron optical ( IR ) photons by their parent relativistic electrons ( SSC process ) . A slight , variable misalignment between the synchrotron and Comptonisation zones would explain the increased\\gammaand X-ray flux levels in 2009\u20132010 , as well as the change in the\\gamma/optical flux ratio during the outbursts peaks . The time delays of the X-ray flux changes after the\\gamma, and optical ones are consistent with the proposed scenario .",

As a special case , we reproduce the Li & Draine ( 2001 ) results , however their model requires an excessive amount of silicon , magnesium , and iron to be locked up in dust : about 50 ppm ( atoms per million of H atoms ) , significantly more than the upper limit imposed by solar abundances of these elements , about 34 , 35 , and 28 ppm , respectively . A major conclusion of this paper is that there is no unique interstellar dust model that simultaneously fits the observed extinction , diffuse IR emission , and abundances constraints . We find several classes of acceptable interstellar dust models , that comply with these constraints . The first class is identical in composition to the Li & Draine model , consisting of PAHs , bare graphite and silicate grains , but with a different size distribution that is optimized to comply with the abundances constraints . The second class of models contains in addition to PAHs bare graphite and silicate grains also composite particles . Other classes contain amorphous carbon instead of graphite particles , or no carbon at all , except for that in PAHs . All classes are consistent with solar and F & G star abundances , but have greater difficulty fitting the B star carbon abundance , which is better fit with the latter ( no carbon ) models . Additional observational constraints , such as the interstellar polarization , or x\u2013ray scattering may be able to discriminate between the various interstellar dust models .",

        "abstract": "Spurred by the recent complete determination of the weak currents in two-nucleon systems up to{ \\cal O } ( Q ^ { 3 } )in heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory , we carry out a parameter-free calculation of the thresholdS-factors for the solarpp( proton-fusion ) andhepprocesses in an effective field theory thatcombinesthe merits of the standard nuclear physics method and systematic chiral expansion . The power of the EFT adopted here is that one can correlate in a unified formalism the weak-current matrix elements of two- , three- and four-nucleon systems . Using the tritium\\beta-decay rate as an input to fix the only unknown parameter in the theory , we can evaluate the thresholdSfactors with drastically improved precision ; the results areS _ { pp } ( 0 ) = 3.94 \\times ( 1 \\pm 0.004 ) \\times 10 ^ { -25 } \\mbox { MeV - b }andS _ { hep } ( 0 ) = ( 8.6 \\pm 1.3 ) \\times 10 ^ { -20 } \\mbox { keV - b }. The dependence of the calculatedS-factors on the momentum cutoff parameter\\Lambdahas been examined for a physically reasonable range of\\Lambda. This dependence is found to be extremely small for theppprocess , and to be within acceptable levels for thehepprocess , substantiating the consistency of our calculational scheme .",
