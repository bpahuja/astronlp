        "abstract": "A recent stellar occultation by dwarf planet Makemake provided an excellent opportunity to measure the size and shape of one of the largest objects in the Kuiper belt . The analysis of these results provided what were reported to be precise measurements of the lengths of the projected axes , the albedo , and even the density of Makemake , but these results were , in part , derived from qualitative arguments . We reanalyzed the occultation timing data using a quantitative statistical description , and , in general , find the previously reported results on the shape of Makemake to be unjustified . In our solution , in which we use our inference from photometric data that Makemake is being viewed nearly pole-on , we find a 1\\sigmaupper limit to the projected elongation of Makemake of 1.02 , with measured equatorial diameter of 1434\\pm14 km and a projected polar diameter of 1422\\pm14 km , yielding an albedo of 0.81^ { +0.01 } _ { -0.02 }. If we remove the external constraint on the pole position of Makemake , we find instead a 1\\sigmaupper limit to the elongation of 1.06 , with a measured equatorial diameter of 1434^ { +48 } _ { -18 }km and a projected polar diameter of 1420^ { +18 } _ { -24 }km , yielding an albedo of 0.81^ { +0.03 } _ { -0.05 }. Critically , we find that the reported measurement of the density of Makemake was based on the misapplication of the volatile retention models . A corrected analysis shows that the occultation measurements provide no meaningful constraint on the density of Makemake .",

Using our global , self-consistent , multi-band model of nearby well-observed supernovae , we find that the covariances of these quantities are strong and that the confidence ellipsoids are oriented in the direction of the correlations , which reduces their significance . By proper treatment of the covariance matrix of the model , we discover a significant intrinsic width to the correlations betweenL _ { pl },E _ { exp }andM _ { Ni }, where the uncertainties due to the distance and the extinction dominate . For fixedE _ { exp }, the spread inM _ { Ni }is about0.25dex , which we attribute to the differences in the progenitor internal structure . We argue that the effects of incomplete\\gamma-ray trapping are not important in our sample . Similarly , the physics of the Type II-Plateau supernova light curves leads to inherently degenerate estimates ofE _ { exp }andM _ { ej }, which makes their observed correlation weak . Ignoring the covariances of supernova parameters or the intrinsic width of the correlations causes significant biases in the slopes of the fitted relations . Our results imply that Type II-Plateau supernova explosions are not described by a single physical parameter or a simple one-dimensional trajectory through the parameter space , but instead reflect the diversity of the core and surface properties of their progenitors . We discuss the implications for the physics of the explosion mechanism and possible future observational constraints .",

        "abstract": "Precision astrometry is an integral component of successful pulsar timing campaigns . Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as parameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival ( TOAs ) . TOAs measured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield position measurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision . However , timing-based astrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise , which can be compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitational wave background . We investigate how noise of different spectral types is absorbed by timing models , leading to significant estimation biases in the astrometric parameters . We find that commonly used techniques for fitting timing models in the presence of red noise ( Cholesky whitening ) prevent the absorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline of observations exceeds several years , but are inadequate for dealing with shorter pulsar data sets . Independent of timing , pulsar-optimized very long baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) is capable of providing position estimates precise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing . In order to make VLBI astrometric parameters useful in pulsar timing models , the transformation between the International Celestial Reference Frame ( ICRF ) and the dynamical solar system ephemeris used for pulsar timing must be constrained to within a few microarcseconds . We compute a transformation between the ICRF and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how the transformation will improve in coming years . We find that incorporating VLBI astrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of years of timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noise and could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fit timing residuals by factors of 20 or more .",
