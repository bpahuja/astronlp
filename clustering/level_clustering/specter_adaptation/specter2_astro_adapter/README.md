- source_sentence: When the three classes of stars are considered we have a =3.43
    ( MAIN ) , a =2.79 ( GIANTS ) and a =2.43 ( SUPERGIANTS ) , seeÂ Zaninetti ( 57
    ) for further details . We have split the analysis of the luminosity function
    in two .
  sentences:
  - The PSFs inferred from the geometry of collimators can be described as where [MATH_tex=alpha]
    and [MATH_tex=beta] are the source ’ s position relative to the long side and
    short side of a telescope , respectively , [MATH_tex=alpha_0] and [MATH_tex=beta_0]
    are the sizes of the long side and short side of the FOV ( FWHM ) which are listed
    in Tab . 1 and illustrated in Fig . 3 , [MATH_tex=C] is the normalized flux of
    the source .
  - We selected only sources with 2-10 keV fluxes above [MATH_tex=1.4times 10^-10]
    erg s [MATH_tex=^-1] cm [MATH_tex=^-2] which ensures that their luminosity is
    not lower than [MATH_tex=2-3times 10^36] erg/s up to distances of 12 kpc ( i.e
    .
  - The main sources of error come from the small dependence of energy resolution
    on the observation conditions , the imperfect knowledge of the energy scale ,
    and the influence of the variation of the night sky background ( NSB ) The NSB
    corresponds to the optical photons emitted from bright stars in the field of view
    of the telescope . in the field of view on the event count measurements .
- source_sentence: The features of the acoustic peaks are not distinguished with the
    coarse binning , but with the fluctuation band-power measured to [MATH_tex=5%]
    , this spectrum offers a powerful probe of cosmological fluctuations at small
    scales .
  sentences:
  - 'This physics includes : star formation , stellar feedback , black hole growth
    and active galactic nuclei ( AGN ) feedback , which happen on sub-pc scales ,
    while the highest resolution available for cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations
    is a few [MATH_tex=100] pc .'
  - Dividing the galaxy mass range into two groups , the [MATH_tex=M_B] of SNe Ia
    shows a step of [MATH_tex=sim] 0.07-0.10 mag dex [MATH_tex=^-1] in the residuals
    plot ( see 7 , mainly Table 2 , where observational trends from different authors
    are compiled ) between both bins . We have observations for 28 local galaxies
    hosting SNe Ia with the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope ( WHT ) at El Roque de
    Los Muchachos Observatory , La Palma , Spain , in two campaigns in December 2011
    ( 9 galaxies ) and January 2014 ( 19 galaxies ) .
  - If not noted otherwise , all results in this section have been obtained using
    a double precision , shock-capturing , unsplit , adiabatic MHD solver consisting
    of Van Leer integration , piecewise linear reconstruction , Roe Riemann solver
    , and constrained transport for the integration of the induction equation ( see
    , e.g. , <CIT> for more details ) .
- source_sentence: 'We investigated the mid-IR colors of the objects based on data
    from the publicly accessible catalogs of the WISE space observatory . The spectroscopy
    for a number of objects from the sample was performed at the Russian-Turkish 1.5-m
    telescope ( RTT-150 ) with the medium- and low resolution TFOSC http : //hea.iki.rssi.ru/rtt150/ru/index.php
    ? page=tfosc spectrograph For this purpose , we used the N15 grism , which gives
    the widest wavelength range <CIT> and the greatest quantum efficiency .'
  sentences:
  - The two areas studied are the [MATH_tex=ell] = 30 [MATH_tex=degr] and [MATH_tex=ell]
    = 40 [MATH_tex=degr] fields of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope ( JCMT ) Plane
    Survey ( JPS ; \citealt Moore15 , Eden17 ) .
  - 'In order to deal with such problems , one may consider two different approaches
    : ( i ) follow the evolution of the stars ; or , ( ii ) follow the dynamical evolution
    of the stellar system . The ideal approach would be a combination of both a [MATH_tex=N]
    -body simulation and a stellar population synthesis model .'
  - Although current SNe data do not provide competitive constraints , it is interesting
    to see that even in the near future DES is already commissioning and a couple
    of low-z SN project releases are expected for the next years , such as Supernovae
    Factory ( ) , Carnegie Supernovae Project ( ) , La Silla/QUEST ( ) , SkyMapper
    ( ) , and Palomar Transient Factory ( ) . the statistical power on SNe will be
    very competitive and complement well for instance the Planck CMB contours , which
    in fact only achieve the quoted percent-level measurements of [MATH_tex=sigma_8]
    ( ) by assuming [MATH_tex=gammaequiv 0.55] . In this paper we present current
    constraints and future forecasts on the matter power spectrum and growth of structure
    using supernovae data only .
- source_sentence: Since the stochastic gradient descent method is a relatively fast
    optimization algorithm , we first use this method to optimize the cost function
    for different neural network configurations and examine which model is better
    by comparing their test accuracies .
  sentences:
  - We observed that the resulting error distributions barely change . In this section
    , we proceed to several comparisons with respect to external datasets , in order
    to validate our atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances . We finally compare
    [MATH_tex=textitT_texteff] , [MATH_tex=textlog(textitg)] , and [MATH_tex=[textM/textH]]
    derived from purely spectroscopic data by our CNN to those of the high-resolution
    sample presented in Sect 6.4 ( only stars with [MATH_tex=S/N>20] ) .
  - The results to be discussed below come mainly from simulations of [MATH_tex=128^3]
    , [MATH_tex=256^3] or [MATH_tex=512^3] boxes , in various cosmological epochs
    ( matter domination , radiation domination and so on ) for the ideal class of
    models with all values of [MATH_tex=N] between 2 and 20 .
  - It is well known that parameter estimation and credible interval construction
    based upon Bayesian statistical inference are always subject to a greater or lesser
    extent to our choice of the prior probability distribution <CIT> , i.e. , the
    weights we assign to various parameter regions to quantify our beliefs about these
    regions before we look at the data .
- source_sentence: In BHAC the general relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics
    equations are actually solved , however we adopt a flat spacetime , where the
    lapse function is set to unity , the shift vector is a three-vector equal to zero
    , and the spatial metric is the identity [MATH_tex=3times 3] matrix ( Ripperda
    et al. , in prep .
  sentences:
  - 'This is the largest fully-resolved dataset for a Pm study . We carried out DNS
    of the incompressible MHD equations where [MATH_tex=bmu] is the velocity field
    , [MATH_tex=bmb] is the magnetic field in Alfvén units , [MATH_tex=P] is the total
    pressure , the density is constant and set to 1 , and [MATH_tex=bmf] is a random
    force defined via a helical basis : where [MATH_tex=bme_1cdotbme_2^*=bme_1cdotbmk=bme_2cdot%'
  - The physical nature of this component , named Dark Energy , is yet unknown and
    its abundance can not be inferred from a-priori principles , whilst it is widely
    believed that dark energy is the biggest puzzle in standard cosmology today ;
    e.g. , the value of the cosmological constant in cosmology seems absurdly small
    in the context of quantum physics <CIT> .
  - 'Here , [MATH_tex=m_j] is the mass of the [MATH_tex=j] th particle , [MATH_tex=W]
    is a smoothing function . For a derivation of the SPH formulation of the basic
    equations of hydrodynamics we refer the reader to e.g . , where the equations
    are derived from a Lagrangian variational principle . The equations for the smoothing
